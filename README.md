# jscookie

## Usage
Include the following anywhere in your HTML document:
```html
<script src="https://kree-nickm.github.io/jscookie/jscookie.js"></script>
```
Define a data-cookie attribute to any input, and that input will be saved to a cookie every time it is changed. When the user reloads the page, that element will have its value loaded from the cookie.
